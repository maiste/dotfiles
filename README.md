## My dotfiles

### Info

This repository contains my dotfiles. I'm currently using archlinux base
distrobitions but sometimes when it breaks, I use fedora.

To install my dotfiles I have written a script. You can execute it as follow:
```sh
 $ ./install-script [CMD]
```

### Actual configuration

 * **Archlinux** based
 * **I3** as window manager
 * **Dmenu** as app launcher
 * **Zsh** as shell
 * **Alacritty** as terminal
 * **Neovim** to code and take notes
