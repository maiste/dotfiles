    # Otherwise, fonts are interpreted in Pango format.

# --- Behaviour --- #

    # Hide the mouse cursor.
    hide-cursor = true

    # Show a text cursor in the input field.
    text-cursor = true

    # Sort results by number of usages in run and drun modes.
    history = true

    # Use fuzzy matching for searches.
    fuzzy-match = false

    # If true, require a match to allow a selection to be made. If false,
    # making a selection with no matches will print input to stdout.
    # In drun mode, this is always true.
    require-match = true

    # If true, automatically accept a result if it is the only one
    # remaining. If there's only one result on startup, window creation is
    # skipped altogether.
    auto-accept-single = false

    # If true, typed input will be hidden, and what is displayed (if
    # anything) is determined by the hidden-character option.
    hide-input = false

    # Replace displayed input characters with a character. If the empty
    # string is given, input will be completely hidden.
    # This option only has an effect when hide-input is set to true.
    hidden-character = "*"

    # If true, directly launch applications on selection when in drun mode.
    # Otherwise, just print the command line to stdout.
    drun-launch = false

    # Delay keyboard initialisation until after the first draw to screen.
    # This option is experimental, and will cause tofi to miss keypresses
    # for a short time after launch. The only reason to use this option is
    # performance on slow systems.
    late-keyboard-init = false

    # If true, allow multiple simultaneous processes.
    # If false, create a lock file on startup to prevent multiple instances
    # from running simultaneously.
    multi-instance = false

    # Assume input is plain ASCII, and disable some Unicode handling
    # functions. This is faster, but means e.g. a search for "e" will not
    # match "Ã©".
